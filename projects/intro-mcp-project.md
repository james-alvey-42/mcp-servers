# Introduction to MCP: Building Your First Multi-Agent Integration Project

## Project Overview

This introductory project is designed to familiarize you with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework before integrating it with more complex workflows. The first aim is to build a complete MCP-based system that demonstrates the development of custom MCP servers as well as their integration with the various API clients that can utilize them.

**Key Learning Objective:** Understand that MCP servers provide standardized interfaces (tools, resources, prompts) that can be consumed by multiple different AI systems and clients.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Project Scoping and MCP Architecture Design

**Objective:** Design a project that utilizes all three core MCP primitives: tools, resources, and prompts. Ideally develop multiple MCP servers that do different jobs (e.g. fetching data, analysing data etc.)

**Suggested Project Ideas:**
1. **Weather Analysis System** - Tools for fetching weather data, resources for historical weather patterns, prompts for analysis templates
2. **Task Management Hub** - Tools for CRUD operations, resources for project status, prompts for productivity analysis
3. **Data Pipeline Monitor** - Tools for pipeline control, resources for system metrics, prompts for alert generation
4. **Content Analysis Platform** - Tools for text processing, resources for analysis results, prompts for report generation

**Deliverable:** Project specification document outlining:
- Problem statement and scope
- MCP architecture diagram
- Detailed specification of tools, resources, and prompts
- Expected data flows and interactions

### Step 2: MCP Server Implementation

**Objective:** Build MCP servers using established patterns from the mcp-servers repository.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Follow the FastMCP framework patterns demonstrated in existing servers
- Use the provider abstraction layer for external service integration
- Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
- Include structured output using Pydantic models

**Reference Implementations:**
- **LLM API Bridge Server:** [mcp-servers/llm-api-bridge/](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/mcp-servers/tree/main/llm-api-bridge)
  - Example of multi-provider architecture
  - Demonstrates tools, resources, and prompts integration
  - Shows environment-based configuration management

- **ArXiv Paper Downloader:** [mcp-servers/arxiv-downloader/](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/mcp-servers/tree/main/arxiv-downloader)
  - Example of external API integration
  - Demonstrates file management and structured data handling
  - Shows comprehensive testing and documentation patterns

**Required Components:**
- `server.py` - Main FastMCP server implementation
- `providers/` - Abstraction layer for external services (if needed)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Server documentation and setup guide
- `TESTING.md` - Testing procedures and validation steps

**Development Pattern Reference:**
```python
# Follow established patterns from existing servers
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio

mcp = FastMCP("Your Server Name")

@mcp.tool()
def your_tool(param: str) -> dict:
    """Tool description for MCP clients."""
    # Implementation following established error handling patterns
    pass

@mcp.resource("resource_uri")
def your_resource() -> dict:
    """Resource description for MCP clients."""
    # Implementation following established data patterns
    pass

@mcp.prompt("prompt_name")
def your_prompt() -> dict:
    """Prompt template for MCP clients."""
    # Implementation following established template patterns
    pass
```

**Deliverable:** Complete MCP server with:
- All planned tools, resources, and prompts implemented
- Provider abstraction (if external APIs used)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Validated functionality using MCP Inspector

### Step 3: Multi-Client Integration

**Objective:** Interface your MCP servers with multiple API clients to demonstrate the protocol's versatility.

**Example Client Integrations:**

#### 3.1 Claude Desktop Integration
- Configure `claude_desktop_config.json` for your server
- Test all MCP primitives through Claude Desktop interface
- Document user experience and interaction patterns

#### 3.2 LLM CLI Tools (Gemini/Claude)
- Integrate with Google Gemini CLI tools
- Integrate with Claude CLI tools
- Compare interaction patterns between different LLM providers
- Document API differences and capabilities

#### 3.3 AG2 Multi-Agent Systems
- Build AG2 agents that use your MCP servers
- Demonstrate multi-agent coordination using MCP tools
- Show how different agents can utilize different MCP primitives
- Document agent interaction patterns and coordination strategies

#### 3.4 Custom MCP Client
- Build a custom Python client using MCP protocol
- Reference the existing custom client: [mcp-servers/mcp-client/](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/mcp-servers/tree/main/mcp-client)
- Demonstrate programmatic access to all MCP primitives

**Custom Client Reference Pattern:**
```python
# Based on mcp-servers/mcp-client/client.py
import asyncio
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

async def run_custom_client():
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="python", 
        args=["path/to/your/server.py"]
    )
    
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            # Initialize and use your MCP server
            await session.initialize()
            # Call tools, access resources, use prompts
```

**Deliverable:** Working integrations with all four client types, including:
- Configuration files and setup documentation
- Example interactions and use cases for each client
- Comparative analysis of client capabilities and limitations
- Performance and usability observations

### Step 4: API Functionality Exploration

**Objective:** Explore and compare how different API clients utilize MCP primitives to solve your core problem.

**Analysis Framework:**

#### 4.1 Tool Execution Patterns
- Compare how different clients invoke MCP tools
- Analyze parameter passing and result handling
- Document error handling across clients
- Measure performance characteristics

#### 4.2 Resource Access Strategies
- Compare resource querying patterns
- Analyze data representation and transformation
- Document caching and efficiency considerations
- Evaluate real-time vs. batch access patterns

#### 4.3 Prompt Utilization Methods
- Compare how clients use MCP prompts
- Analyze template customization and parameter injection
- Document output formatting and post-processing
- Evaluate prompt chaining and composition strategies

#### 4.4 Multi-Agent Coordination
- Demonstrate how AG2 agents can coordinate using MCP
- Show parallel vs. sequential tool execution
- Document agent communication patterns
- Analyze conflict resolution and resource sharing

#### 4.5 Client-Specific Capabilities
- Document unique features of each client type
- Identify optimal use cases for each integration
- Analyze limitations and workarounds
- Recommend client selection criteria

**Deliverable:** Comprehensive analysis document including:
- Detailed comparison of client capabilities
- Performance benchmarks and optimization recommendations
- Use case recommendations for each client type
- Integration best practices and lessons learned
- Future integration possibilities and research directions
