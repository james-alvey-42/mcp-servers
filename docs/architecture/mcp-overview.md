# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. It provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol.

## Core Architecture

MCP is built on proven foundations, adapting from the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and using JSON-RPC 2.0 for communication.

### Key Components

1. **MCP Server**: Exposes resources, tools, and prompts to LLM applications
2. **MCP Client**: Connects to MCP servers and integrates with LLM applications
3. **Transport Layer**: Handles communication between clients and servers

## Server Capabilities

MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:

### 1. Resources
- Think of these like GET endpoints
- Used to load information into the LLM's context
- Examples: file contents, database records, API responses

### 2. Tools
- Similar to POST endpoints
- Used to execute code or produce side effects
- Examples: file operations, API calls, calculations

### 3. Prompts
- Reusable templates for LLM interactions
- Define interaction patterns and context structures
- Help standardize common workflows

## Protocol Features

### Security & Authentication
- OAuth 2.1 framework for authenticating remote HTTP servers
- Secure two-way connections between data sources and AI tools
- Built-in security considerations for enterprise use

### Scalability
- JSON-RPC 2.0 based communication
- Efficient resource management
- Support for concurrent operations

### Living Specification
- Actively maintained on GitHub
- Regular updates for improved functionality
- Community-driven development

## Ecosystem

### Official SDKs
- **Python SDK**: Official Python implementation
- **TypeScript SDK**: Official TypeScript/JavaScript implementation
- **Additional SDKs**: Java, Kotlin, C#

### Pre-built Servers
Available for popular enterprise systems:
- Google Drive
- Slack
- GitHub
- Git
- PostgreSQL
- Puppeteer
- And many more

## Use Cases

1. **Data Integration**: Connect LLMs to databases, APIs, and file systems
2. **Tool Extension**: Add custom functionality to LLM applications
3. **Enterprise Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing business systems
4. **Research Tools**: Build specialized tools for academic and research contexts
