- **Tools:** Execute actions and functions
- **Resources:** Provide contextual data
- **Prompts:** Reusable interaction templates

### FastMCP Framework
Uses the high-level FastMCP Python framework:
- Decorator-based API (`@mcp.tool()`, `@mcp.resource()`, `@mcp.prompt()`)
- Structured output with Pydantic models
- Built-in development and testing tools

### Provider Abstraction
Consistent interface across different services:
- Unified API for multiple LLM providers
- Standardized response formats
- Pluggable provider architecture

## üîí Security

- **Environment-based configuration** for API keys
- **No hardcoded secrets** in any codebase
- **Comprehensive security documentation**
- **Best practices for production deployment**

See [API Key Management Guide](docs/security/api-key-management.md) for detailed security practices.

## ü§ù Contributing

### Getting Started
1. Review [MCP Overview](docs/architecture/mcp-overview.md)
2. Set up [Python Development Environment](docs/tutorials/python-development-setup.md)
3. Follow [FastMCP Implementation Guide](docs/tutorials/fastmcp-implementation-guide.md)

### Development Workflow
- Each server follows the established patterns
- Comprehensive testing with MCP Inspector
- Documentation for all features
- Security review for API integrations

## üìû Support

### Documentation First
- Check the relevant server README
- Review troubleshooting sections in documentation
- Test basic connectivity with echo tools

### Common Issues
- **Server won't start:** Check Python version (3.10+) and dependencies
- **API key errors:** Verify environment variable configuration  
- **Connection issues:** Test with MCP Inspector first

## üåü Project Vision

This project demonstrates the power of the Model Context Protocol for creating unified, secure, and extensible LLM integrations. By providing multiple servers with consistent interfaces, we enable:

- **Seamless LLM provider switching** and comparison
- **Research workflow automation** with academic tools
- **Productivity enhancement** through calendar and task integration
- **Educational resources** for MCP development

The goal is to create a comprehensive toolkit that bridges the gap between AI capabilities and practical daily workflows, all while maintaining security and ease of use.
