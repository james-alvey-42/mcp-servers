What are Embeddings?

  Embeddings are high-dimensional numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Think
  of them as "coordinates" in a mathematical space where similar concepts are located near each other.

  For example:
  - The words "simulation" and "modeling" would have similar embeddings (close in vector space)
  - "Galaxy clustering" and "cosmological analysis" would be nearby
  - "Machine learning" and "neural networks" would cluster together

  How They're Computed in Your System

  In your implementation (step2_simple_rag.py), embeddings are created using OpenAI's
  text-embedding-3-large model:

  response = self.client.embeddings.create(
      input=batch_texts,
      model="text-embedding-3-large"  # 3072-dimensional vectors
  )

  The Process:
  1. Input: Your document chunks (text segments ~3000 characters)
  2. Model: OpenAI's neural network processes the text
  3. Output: A 3072-dimensional vector for each chunk
  4. Storage: These vectors are stored in ChromaDB for fast similarity search

  What the model considers:
  - Word meanings and relationships
  - Context and sentence structure
  - Scientific terminology and concepts
  - Semantic relationships between ideas

  When to Recompute Embeddings

  You need to recompute embeddings when:

  1. Adding New Documents ✅ Most Common

  # Add new PDFs to arxiv_pdfs/
  python step1_convert_pdfs.py  # Convert new PDFs
  python step2_simple_rag.py    # Recompute embeddings for all docs

  2. Changing Chunking Strategy

  If you modify in local_config.py:
  CHUNK_SIZE = 5000      # Changed from 3000
  CHUNK_OVERLAP = 500    # Changed from 300
  Different chunks = need new embeddings

  3. Switching Embedding Models

  # If you change from:
  OpenAI_Embedding_Model = "text-embedding-3-large"  # 3072 dimensions
  # To:
  OpenAI_Embedding_Model = "text-embedding-3-small"  # 1536 dimensions
  Different models produce incompatible embeddings

  4. Improving Document Processing

  - Better PDF extraction methods
  - Cleaning text formatting
  - Removing headers/footers
  - Fixing encoding issues

  What You DON'T Need to Recompute For:

  ❌ Changing query parameters (TOP_K, DISTANCE_THRESHOLD)
  ❌ Changing the generation model (GPT-4o-mini → GPT-4)
  ❌ Modifying prompts or system instructions
  ❌ Adding metadata (as long as text content is unchanged)

  Technical Details

  Your Current Setup:
  - Model: text-embedding-3-large
  - Dimensions: 3072 per vector
  - Total vectors: 104 (one per chunk)
  - Storage size: ~50MB in ChromaDB
  - Cost: ~$0.013 per million input tokens

  Performance Characteristics:
  - Similarity Search: Cosine similarity between query and document vectors
  - Speed: Very fast once computed (milliseconds per query)
  - Quality: High semantic understanding of scientific content

  Practical Workflow

  For your current system:
  # Check if embeddings exist and are up-to-date
  python -c "
  from step2_simple_rag import SimpleRAGSystem
  r = SimpleRAGSystem()
  r.setup_chromadb()
  print(f'Current embeddings: {r.collection.count()} chunks')
  "

  # If you need to refresh everything:
  rm -rf embeddings/chromadb/  # Delete old embeddings
  python step2_simple_rag.py   # Recreate everything

  Cost Optimization:
  - Embeddings are a one-time cost per document
  - Queries only cost generation tokens (much cheaper)
  - Batch processing (like you're doing) is most efficient

  The beauty of embeddings is that once computed, you get extremely fast semantic search without
  re-processing on every query. Your 104 chunks can be searched in milliseconds, making the system very
   responsive for interactive use.
